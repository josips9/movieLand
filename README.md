# Movie Land app + Vite

This repo is made by following this tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9eMGE7QtTk&ab_channel=JavaScriptMastery but instead create-react-app I'm using Vite

During development I run into some issues with loading .svg file. Vite solve those issues.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
